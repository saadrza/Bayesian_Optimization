This Python code utilizes the PyTorch and GPyTorch libraries to define a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model. The get_gp function takes input data X and corresponding targets y, along with specified components for the mean (mean_module), covariance (covar_module), and likelihood of the GP. It then creates a SingleTaskGP (a type of Gaussian Process model) using these components.

The SingleTaskGP is configured with the provided mean, covariance, and likelihood modules. The ExactMarginalLogLikelihood (mll) is also instantiated, serving as the objective function for training the GP. This function is essential for maximizing the likelihood of the observed data under the GP model.

This code is a modular and reusable way to set up a Gaussian Process regression model, allowing users to easily experiment with different mean, covariance, and likelihood functions for various tasks in machine learning, optimization, or Bayesian modeling.
